## Examples

### Websocket: How to stream data from multiple channel and write to multiple outputs
- `examples/ws-multi-channel-multi-output`

### Earnings and Institutional Holdings

- This notebook collects upcoming earnings information and uses those tickers to analyze high-profile institutional holdings

### Market Tide
- `examples/market-tide`
- This notebook collects market tide and OHLC price data (for ticker `SPY`) then plots them

### Flow Alerts
- `examples/flow-alerts-multiple-tickers`
- This notebook interacts with the Flow Alerts endpoint to collect filtered data then further refines the results

### Net Premium Ticks Dashboard
